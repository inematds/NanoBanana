Digital Painting & Concept Art Style
Characteristics

The digital painting style refers to artwork that looks like it was painted or illustrated digitally, akin to concept art found on ArtStation or in video game design. It often features painterly brushstrokes (sometimes visible if mimicking oils or watercolor), rich blending of colors, dramatic lighting, and a high level of detail.

Commonly, these images have a fantastical or imaginative quality, depicting mythical creatures, futuristic cities, or detailed character designs. The compositions tend to be dynamic and cinematic, reflecting the influence of sci-fi art and illustrative concept art.

Origins and Influence

This style is rooted in traditional painting (oil, acrylic, etc.) but more directly in the modern concept art and illustration industry. Influences include fantasy art legends (like Frank Frazetta, who painted Conan and other heroes) and contemporary digital artists.

In the AI world, this style surged in popularity around 2022: users discovered the models could mimic famous digital painters, leading to controversy when artists like Rutkowski saw their style reproduced without consent. Indeed, Rutkowski’s name was used in AI prompts over 400,000 times, more than even “Picasso,” symbolizing how much AI art leaned on the digital painting aesthetic.

All this underscores that digital painting and concept art remains a staple style in AI image generation, influential in shaping the quality and detail people now expect from AI art.

Usage

This style is widely used for concept art, book covers, and fantasy/sci-fi illustrations. AI-generated digital paintings are popular among game developers and authors to visualize characters or worlds. They’re also shared across art communities for their beauty—think dragons, wizards, spacecraft, or elaborate scenery suitable for a novel cover.

While you can generate digital paintings and concept art with various models, our recommendation is to use the Lucid Origin model in the Leonardo.Ai app.

Fantasy Art Style
Characteristics

Fantasy art is a beloved subgenre of illustration focused on mythical or magical themes. AI-generated fantasy art usually depicts epic otherworldly scenes: grand medieval-esque landscapes, heroic characters like knights, wizards or elves, and legendary creatures (dragons, unicorns, etc.).

The style often features dramatic, high-contrast lighting (rays of sunlight in enchanted forests, or glowing magic effects), intricate costumes or armor, and a “larger-than-life” atmosphere. Colors might be rich and vibrant, emphasizing the fantastical elements. Overall, it aims to transport the viewer to an imaginary realm, with a detailed, often painterly style (closely tied to the digital painting aesthetic, but defined by its subject matter).

Images generated with Leonardo.Ai using the model Lucid Origin
Origins and Influence

Fantasy art as a genre has roots in ancient mythology and folklore, but as a visual style it solidified in the 20th century through illustrators for fantasy literature. Influential figures include J.R.R. Tolkien’s illustrators and artists like Frank Frazetta (known for Conan the Barbarian paintings) and John Howe. These set the visual language of heroic quests and mystical lands.

Their legacy influences AI outputs—many prompts reference specific fantasy artists or well-known franchises. Earlier AI trends included style-transfer applying classic fantasy art styles, but the real influence came as AI models learned from the vast troves of fantasy artwork online.

By 2025, fantasy art remains central in AI image generation, blending with AI’s capacity to mash up imaginative concepts. It’s noteworthy that the fantasy style itself has sub-styles (dark fantasy, high fantasy, gothic fantasy, etc.), and AI tools can cater to these nuances. Overall, fantasy art is both an earlier influence and a continuously dominant style in the AI art space.

Usage

Fantasy style AI art is popular for book covers, game art, and personal creativity. Authors use it to visualize novel cover art or characters; tabletop gamers generate scenes of their campaigns; and many hobbyists create fantasy portraits. It’s also big in NFT art and concept art contests.

The style is commonly seen on art platforms where AI users share images of castles, dragons fighting warriors, mystical landscapes, etc. The resurgence of fantasy media (e.g. Game of Thrones, popular RPG video games) keeps this style in demand.

While you can use various models to generate fantasy AI art, we recommend using the Lucid Origin model inside the Leonardo.Ai app.

Western Cartoon & Comic Style
Characteristics

Beyond anime, AI can also generate art in a Western cartoon or comic book style. This category includes everything from classic 20th-century cartoon looks (bold outlines, flat colors) to modern graphic novel aesthetics (halftone shading, comic panel style).

These images are typically playful and exaggerated; characters might have simplified features or humorous proportions. Colors are often bright and solid, and line art is clean. In comic-style outputs, one might see speech bubbles or panel arrangements, and stylized text, imitating the look of comic strips or superhero comic art.

Images generated with Leonardo.Ai using the model Lucid Origin
Origins and Influence

This style is drawn from Western animation and illustration history—from newspaper comic strips to Marvel/DC comic art and Saturday-morning cartoons. Early AI style-transfer experiments could apply comic book filters to images, but now generative models can produce original cartoon scenes.

This style is deeply ingrained in popular use, partly because it’s fun and accessible. It continues to grow with AI tools now able to simulate specific comic artists or animate-like sequences, appealing to both casual users and professional illustrators looking to prototype ideas—to learn more, check out our guide on storyboarding with AI.

Usage

Cartoon-style AI art is popular for avatars, memes, and children’s content. Users create cartoon versions of themselves or generate new cartoon characters for fun. It’s also used in storyboard visualization—for instance, quickly drafting a comic scene or an illustration for an article.

Social media sees a lot of cartoon selfies and comic-style memes (turning a photo into a comic panel, etc.), because the format is eye-catching and approachable. Some educators and marketers use AI cartoons for explainer graphics or infographics, since the style can simplify complex ideas into friendly visuals.

Overall, the versatility and broad appeal of cartoons mean this style is widely utilized. In fact, its versatility is a reason it remains trending for social media content and marketing.

While you can use various models to generate cartoon and comic AI art, we recommend using the Lucid Origin model inside the Leonardo.Ai app.

CGI & 3D Rendered Style
Characteristics

The 3D render style refers to images that look like CGI (computer-generated imagery) or 3D art, as opposed to flat 2D drawings. These images have realistic depth, shading, and often a smooth, polished look as if created in a 3D modeling software.

A common thread is the presence of simulated lighting effects (like reflections, shadows) and sometimes a slight “plastic” or clay texture on subjects if mimicking claymation or figurines. In essence, the style makes the AI output appear as if it’s a snapshot of a 3D model or animation frame.

Origins and Influence

This style stems from the CGI revolution in movies and video games. Early on, generative models were mostly 2D-focused, but as they trained on more diverse art, they learned to mimic 3D lighting and perspective.

For instance, prompts including phrases like “3D render” or “Octane render” became common to achieve that look. The influence of specific mediums (like clay or plastic models) also led to sub-styles (e.g. “claymation style” AI images). By now, 3D-rendered style images are common, and AI art trends even blend them with others (imagine a “3D anime figure” style, combining two popular looks).

The popularity of this style is growing, especially in advertising and design, as AI can quickly produce near-professional CGI-like visuals without the need for actual 3D modeling. It exemplifies how AI art straddles the line between traditional artistry and computer graphics.

Usage

This style is popular for toy design, character design, and product visualization. For example, creators generate adorable 3D characters or mascots. Whimsical 3D figures with vibrant colors often appear in marketing visuals and digital art displays because they grab attention.

The 3D style is also used for architecture and interior design previews—an AI image might show a room or building as if it were a 3D render. Additionally, some use it for concept art of sculptures or installation art. In 2025, one trend in this vein is “Playful 3D Art”—creating cute, dynamic 3D scenes that feel joyful and engaging. This has been seen in everything from promotional graphics to NFT collections of little 3D characters.

While you can use various models to generate 3d-rendered and CGI AI art, we recommend using the Lucid Origin model inside the Leonardo.Ai app.

Pixel Art & Retro Game Style
Characteristics

Pixel art style involves images rendered at a low resolution such that individual pixels are visible, recreating the look of 1980s–90s video game graphics. AI-generated pixel art typically uses a limited color palette and blocky shading. Despite the simplicity, good pixel art still conveys subject detail in a tiny grid of pixels.

Many such images are 8-bit or 16-bit retro in appearance—for example, reminiscent of old Nintendo or Sega game sprites. The style often includes stylized aspects like chiptune-era icons, simple geometric forms, and sometimes text or UI elements mimicking game screens. Overall, the charm of pixel art lies in its expressive minimalism and nostalgia.

Images generated with Leonardo.Ai using the model Lucid Origin
Origins and Influence

Pixel art originates from the technical limitations of early video game consoles and computers, which could only display low-resolution graphics. Artists turned those limitations into an art form. Iconic games like Super Mario Bros., The Legend of Zelda, or Pokémon defined the pixel art look that is now nostalgically emulated.

Modern diffusion models can produce surprisingly coherent pixel art on demand. The resurgence of retro gaming and “lo-fi” art trends has certainly influenced AI art—as noted, nostalgia for 8-bit aesthetics keeps this style trending. It may not be as dominant as photorealism or anime in sheer volume, but it’s a beloved niche.

Usage

Pixel art generated by AI is popular among gaming enthusiasts and for nostalgia-themed projects. People create pixel avatars or scenes that look like vintage game screenshots. It’s also used in indie game development as a starting point for sprites or background art.

On social media, one might see AI pixel art depicting modern concepts (say, a scene from a new movie) as if it were an old game. The style is used in digital decor, like retro-style GIFs or website graphics.

Because it invokes childhood memories for many, nostalgia is a big driver of interest in pixel art aesthetics. In 2025, even as AI tech is ultra-sophisticated, there’s a concurrent trend of embracing lo-fi and retro looks, so pixel art fits right in.

While you can use various models to generate pixel AI art, we recommend using the Lucid Origin model inside the Leonardo.Ai app.

Traditional & Classical Art Style
Characteristics

AI image generation can mimic traditional art mediums and historic art movements as well. This includes styles like oil painting, watercolor, charcoal sketches, or specific art movements (Renaissance, Impressionism, Art Nouveau, etc.). For example, an AI can create a portrait that looks like a Renaissance oil painting with cracked canvas texture and dramatic light, or a landscape that looks like an impressionist piece with visible brushstrokes.

The hallmark of this category is that the output visibly imitates a manual art technique (brushstrokes, pen and ink lines, etc.) or the stylistic decisions characteristic of a historical period (composition and color of Baroque, geometric patterns of Art Deco, etc.).

Images generated with Leonardo.Ai using the model Lucid Origin
Origins and Influence

Quite literally, the origin here is human art history. Early in the AI art timeline, the Prisma app (2016) and DeepArt allowed turning personal photos into faux paintings, which “brought style transfer to the masses” and made Van Gogh-esque selfies a fad.

These earlier trends influenced the trajectory of AI art by demonstrating public appetite for classic styles reimagined. In 2025, we even see revivals of vintage styles as trends—for example, Art Deco Revival (modern content with 1920s geometric elegance) is a popular AI art trend, combining nostalgia with contemporary flair.

Usage

These styles are often used by art enthusiasts to see modern subjects in a classic style (for instance, generating an image of a 2020s celebrity as if painted by Rembrandt). They’re also used in education and marketing to evoke a certain era or artistic prestige. Some designers might generate a logo or poster with Art Deco elements for a vintage vibe.

Neural style transfer, which became popular around 2016, allowed everyday users to apply famous art styles to their photos. This was an early form of AI art usage that introduced many to the idea of AI-created classical art. In the current generation, people still prompt AI for outputs like “watercolor illustration of X”, especially for creative projects that benefit from a timeless or artistic look.

While you can use various models to generate traditional and classical AI art, or experimental art, we recommend using the Lucid Origin model inside the Leonardo.Ai app.

Surreal, Abstract & Experimental Style
Characteristics

AI art also thrives at producing surreal and abstract styles that break the rules of reality. One facet is the surrealist style —dreamlike imagery with illogical scenes, melting forms, strange juxtapositions and symbolic elements. These images can be whimsical or disturbing, often with fluid, morphing shapes and a mix of realistic and impossible features.

Another facet is psychedelic art, characterized by extremely vibrant colors, kaleidoscopic patterns, and a “trippy” complexity reminiscent of hallucinations. AI is adept at psychedelic visuals, producing intricate fractal-like details and glow effects that give a mind-bending aesthetic.

We also see glitch art, which deliberately includes digital glitches: pixelation, VHS-style scan lines, color distortion, and noise, as if the image file was corrupted. This creates a modern, tech-influenced abstract style with an edgy vibe.

Origins and Influence

Surreal and abstract art predate AI by a century (the Surrealist movement of the 1920s, abstract expressionism, etc.). AI’s ability to merge concepts makes it naturally suited for surrealism—early neural art often resulted in strange, dreamlike outputs by accident. Google’s DeepDream is a key historical influence: it popularized the psychedelic computer-generated look and got mainstream attention.

Similarly, style transfer techniques applied Van Gogh or Picasso styles to photos, blending reality and art in abstract ways. These earlier techniques influenced artists to explore AI for creative distortion. Now in 2025, surreal/abstract AI art is a conscious trend—for example, “Pop Surrealism” (Lowbrow art with pop culture and surreal mix) is noted as a trending AI art style.

Glitch aesthetics come from the tech world and net art culture, and AI has adopted them as another texture or filter to apply. While these styles may not be as broadly popular as, say, anime, they are very significant in showing off AI’s creative potential and continue to grow within artistic communities.
